# Mega Charizard Academy v2 — Complete Redesign

## Story Wrapper

**"Help MCX power up for the ultimate battle!"**

Each mini-game earns MCX a Power Gem. The hub shows MCX with 6 gem slots. As games are completed, gems fill in and MCX visibly grows stronger (brighter flames, bigger wings, more particles). After all 6 gems, MCX performs the Ultimate Blue Flame Attack finale.

## Accurate Mega Charizard X Design

Complete rewrite of the procedural MCX drawing based on official design research:

### Color Palette
- **Body:** Dark charcoal-black with blue undertone (#1B1B2F primary, #2D2D44 midtone)
- **Underbelly:** Sky blue from jaw to tail (#91CCEC primary, #B3E1F1 light)
- **Wing membrane:** Deep blue (#3675AB inner, #37B1E2 lit sections)
- **Flames:** Blue gradient — white core → cyan → deep blue (from mouth CORNERS like whiskers)
- **Eyes:** Crimson red (#CC0000) with white vertical slit pupils
- **Horn/spike tips:** Blue (#37B1E2), bases match dark body
- **Claws:** Bone-white (#D4C8A8)
- **Teeth/fangs:** Off-white (#F0E8D8)

### Body Structure (Key Features)
- 3 horns on back of head (middle is longest), curved upward, blue tips
- 4 shoulder spikes (2 per shoulder), blue tips
- Shorter snout than regular Charizard, larger fangs, nose ridge
- Blue flames CONSTANTLY from mouth corners (like draconic whiskers)
- Wings: larger, scalloped/ragged lower edge, no visible finger strut, deep blue membrane
- Muscular legs, thin arms, fused claw-hands, wrist wing flaps
- Tail: large spike at base, 3 smaller spikes near tip, BLUE tail flame
- Sky-blue underside extends from lower jaw to tail

### Animation Poses (8 poses)
1. **Idle** — gentle bob, wing flap, eye blink, mouth flame flicker
2. **Roar** — head back, jaw wide, massive blue flame burst
3. **Attack** — lean forward, fire breath beam
4. **Perch** — settled on rock/surface, wings folded
5. **Calm-rest** — eyes half-closed, gentle breathing, soft ember glow
6. **Fly** — wings spread wide, soaring pose
7. **Happy** — bouncy nod, wings flutter, brighter flames (for correct answers)
8. **Nudge** — head tilt toward target, gentle gesture (for hints)

## Hub Screen

MCX perched on volcanic mountain (center-right). 6 glowing gem orbs arranged in an arc (left side). Each orb:
- Has a distinct color and icon representing its game
- Glows when available, dims when completed (with gem filled in)
- On hover: MCX turns to look at it, flames brighten
- On click: MCX roars, flies to the game location

**Power meter** at bottom: 6 gem slots, filled gems glow with their color.

**Gem assignments:**
| Game | Gem Color | Icon |
|------|-----------|------|
| Dragon Gem Hunt | Red | Flame |
| Feed the Charmanders | Orange | Dragon |
| Build the Fortress | Green | Shield |
| Magic Runes | Blue | Star |
| Dragon Egg Sort | Purple | Egg |
| Charizard's Kitchen | Gold | Cauldron |

## Mini-Game 1: Dragon Gem Hunt (Colors)

**Story:** "MCX needs colored power gems! Help find the right ones!"

### Flow
1. MCX voice: "Find the RED gem!" (voice + text + MCX holds up a colored flame)
2. 2-4 colored gems float gently across screen (large, glowing, easy to click)
3. Uncle clicks the matching gem
4. **Correct:** MCX breathes fire at the gem → gem flies to MCX → power-up animation, "YES! Red!"
5. **Wrong:** MCX shakes head gently, gem bounces back. "Try again!" Wrong gem dims slightly.
6. After 3 misses: MCX breathes fire toward the correct gem (hint glow), auto-completes with celebration

### Difficulty
- **Owen (2.5):** 2 gems, primary colors only (red/blue/yellow), hint glow on correct gem after 2s
- **Kian (4):** 3-4 gems, includes orange/purple/green, no hints

### Pacing
- **Always waits for uncle to click** — no timeout
- 5 gems per round, ~2-3 minutes total
- Gems drift SLOWLY — kids need time to point and shout

---

## Mini-Game 2: Feed the Charmanders (Counting)

**Story:** "Baby Charmanders hatched! They're hungry — count and feed them!"

### Flow
1. Cute baby Charmanders waddle onto screen (procedurally drawn, smaller/rounder than MCX)
2. Number appears large: "3" with dot pips. Voice: "THREE baby dragons!"
3. Kids count the Charmanders on screen together
4. Uncle clicks to launch fireballs ONE AT A TIME
5. Each fireball arcs SLOWLY to a Charmander → Charmander catches it, cheers, does a little happy dance
6. Count-up display: "1... 2... 3!" with each hit
7. After the right number: all Charmanders cheer together, MCX roars proudly
8. Overshoot (Kian mode): Extra fireball fizzles in mid-air with "too many!" and gentle redirect

### Difficulty
- **Owen (2.5):** Numbers 1-3, Charmanders match count exactly, very slow fireballs
- **Kian (4):** Numbers 1-7, more Charmanders than needed (must stop at right count)

### Pacing
- **Fireballs arc slowly** (1.5-2 second flight time) so kids can count along
- **1-2 second pause between each fireball launch** — uncle must click each time
- Always waits for click — never auto-fires
- 4-5 numbers per round, ~3 minutes total

---

## Mini-Game 3: Build the Fortress (Shapes)

**Story:** "Build MCX's fortress with the right shape blocks!"

### Flow
1. Fortress wall with a glowing shape outline (the missing piece)
2. MCX forges 2-3 shape blocks with blue flame (they appear below)
3. Voice: "Find the CIRCLE!" + shape outline pulses
4. Uncle clicks matching shape
5. **Correct:** MCX grabs the block, flies up, SLAMS it into the wall with impact particles. Tower grows.
6. **Wrong:** Block wobbles and doesn't fit. "That's a square! Try the circle!"
7. After all blocks placed: fortress complete, MCX perches proudly on top

### Difficulty
- **Owen (2.5):** 2 shapes to choose from, circle/square/triangle only
- **Kian (4):** 3 shapes, adds star/heart/diamond, size comparison rounds ("Which is BIGGER?")

### Size Mode (Kian, every other round)
- "Which is bigger?" with 2-3 sized versions of same shape
- Final round always: order Charmander → Charmeleon → Charizard smallest to biggest

### Pacing
- 5 blocks per round, ~2-3 minutes
- Always waits for player

## Mini-Game 4: Magic Runes (Letters + Phonics)

**Story:** "Trace the magic runes to unlock MCX's power!"

### Flow
1. Night sky with stars. A letter outline appears as a constellation.
2. Stars light up in sequence showing the path to trace
3. Uncle clicks stars in order — MCX flies between them leaving a blue fire trail
4. **Proper letter shapes** — S has 8-10 curved points forming a real S, B has 12+ points tracing the bumps
5. After tracing: letter GLOWS, voice says the phonics sound: "S says ssss! S is for Star!"
6. Kian mode: phonics question "What starts with S?" with 3 clickable word options

### Letter Paths (proper curves, many points)
- **C:** 8 points tracing a smooth C curve
- **S:** 10 points tracing a proper S with curves at top and bottom
- **B:** 12 points — down the spine, curve out for top bump, back in, curve out for bottom bump
- **F:** 8 points — down the spine, across the top, across the middle

### Difficulty
- **Owen (2.5):** Stars auto-advance on near-click (very forgiving), 6-8 dots, just recognition
- **Kian (4):** Must click in order, 10-12 dots, phonics questions after tracing

### Pacing
- 3-4 letters per round, ~3 minutes
- Stars pulse gently to show the next one — never rushes

## Mini-Game 5: Dragon Egg Sort (NEW — Colors + Sorting)

**Story:** "Sort the dragon eggs into the right nests before they hatch!"

### Flow
1. 2-3 colored nests at bottom of screen
2. Dragon eggs roll in one at a time from the side
3. Each egg has a clear color (with small sparkles matching)
4. Voice: "This is a BLUE egg! Which nest?"
5. Uncle clicks the matching nest
6. **Correct:** Egg rolls into nest, settles with a glow, MCX breathes warm flame on it
7. **Wrong:** Egg bounces back. "That's the RED nest! Find the BLUE nest!"
8. After all eggs sorted: eggs start to wobble and crack — baby dragons peek out! Celebration!

### Difficulty
- **Owen (2.5):** 2 nests (red/blue), eggs are one color, very clear
- **Kian (4):** 3-4 nests, some eggs have stripes/spots (sort by primary color), size sorting variant

### Pacing
- 5-6 eggs per round, ~2-3 minutes
- Always waits for click
- Eggs wobble impatiently but never auto-sort

---

## Mini-Game 6: Charizard's Kitchen (NEW — Counting + Colors combined)

**Story:** "Help MCX brew a power potion! Follow the recipe!"

### Flow
1. MCX stands next to a large bubbling cauldron
2. Recipe scroll appears: "3 RED berries!" (with number + color dot + berry icon)
3. Various colored berries bounce gently around the screen (large, easy to click)
4. Uncle clicks RED berries one at a time
5. Each berry flies into the cauldron — cauldron bubbles, voice counts: "One! Two! Three!"
6. **Wrong color:** Berry bounces back. "That's BLUE! We need RED!"
7. **Too many:** Cauldron bubbles over briefly. "Oops, that's too many! MCX scoops one out"
8. After correct recipe: Potion glows, MCX tastes it, does a power-up animation

### Difficulty
- **Owen (2.5):** 1-3 of ONE color, big berries, slow
- **Kian (4):** Multi-ingredient recipes: "2 BLUE berries AND 1 YELLOW star!"

### Pacing
- 3-4 recipes per round, ~3 minutes
- Always waits for click
- Berries bounce slowly and are VERY large

## MCX Cutscene Moments

### 1. Opening Mega Evolution (22 seconds)
Existing but with the ACCURATE MCX design. Egg → Charmander → Charmeleon → Charizard → MCX.

### 2. Game Intro Flights
When entering each game from hub, MCX flies from the hub mountain to the game location:
- Gem Hunt: flies over a gem field
- Charmanders: lands near the nest
- Fortress: flies to the construction site
- Runes: soars into the night sky
- Egg Sort: glides to the nesting ground
- Kitchen: walks to the cauldron (rare walking animation!)

### 3. Correct Answer Celebration (3 tiers)
- **Calm:** MCX nods, flames brighten briefly, gentle sparkles
- **Normal:** MCX mini-roar, blue flame burst, screen sparkles
- **Hype:** MCX full roar, massive flame explosion, screen shake, "AMAZING!"

### 4. Wrong Answer Redirect
- MCX tilts head, looks at the wrong choice, shakes head gently
- Then looks toward the correct answer with a subtle flame point

### 5. Game Complete Victory
- MCX does a victory lap — flies in a circle leaving a fire trail
- Collects the Power Gem, gem slots into the hub power meter
- MCX powers up visibly (brighter flames, etc.)

### 6. Calm Resets (between games)
3 variations:
- **Power Up:** MCX meditates, blue energy pulses around body
- **Stargazing:** MCX and kids look at stars, gentle ember glow
- **Flame Rest:** MCX curls up, cozy tail flame, breathing sounds

### 7. Ultimate Finale
After all 6 gems collected:
- MCX fully powered — all gems glow on body
- MCX takes flight, does aerial acrobatics
- Ultimate Blue Flame Attack — fills the whole screen
- "AMAZING TRAINING, TRAINERS! You're the best!"
- Play again option

## Sound Design

### Synthesized SFX (Web Audio API, no external files needed)
- **Whoosh** — fireball launch (filtered noise sweep)
- **Chime** — correct answer (sine harmonics)
- **Bonk** — wrong answer (short low thud)
- **Roar** — MCX celebration (noise + oscillator)
- **Fire crackle** — ambient flames (filtered noise)
- **Impact** — block/gem landing (noise burst)
- **Pop** — star/dot activation (short sine)
- **Bubble** — cauldron (frequency-modulated sine)
- **Hatch crack** — egg hatching (noise crackle)

### Voice (Web Speech API fallback)
- All instructions spoken: "Find the RED gem!", "THREE baby dragons!", etc.
- Turn announcements: "Owen's turn!", "Kian's turn!", "Team turn!"
- Encouragement: "Great job!", "You got it!", "Try again!"
- Uses Web Speech API with kid-friendly settings (rate 0.85, pitch 1.1)
- Ready for real TTS clips when generated

---

## Answer Feedback System

Every game supports clear right/wrong feedback:

### Correct Answer
1. Visual: Target lights up green/gold, particles burst
2. Sound: Chime + MCX mini-roar
3. MCX: Happy pose, flames brighten
4. Voice: "Yes!", "Great!", "That's right!"
5. UI: Brief "GREAT!" text with glow

### Wrong Answer
1. Visual: Target briefly shakes, turns slightly red
2. Sound: Gentle bonk (not punishing)
3. MCX: Head shake, looks toward correct answer
4. Voice: "Not quite!", "Try again!"
5. The wrong choice dims slightly, correct one gets a subtle glow hint

### Auto-Complete (after 3 misses)
1. MCX breathes fire toward the correct answer
2. Answer highlights brightly
3. Voice explains: "It's the RED one! See?"
4. Auto-completes with a gentler celebration (still positive)

## Technical Changes for v2

### Always Wait for Player
- Remove ALL auto-timeouts from games
- Games only advance on uncle's click
- MCX idles patiently (flame flicker, gentle bob) while waiting
- No rushing, no timers visible to kids

### Adaptive Difficulty
- Track correct/wrong answers per session
- If Owen gets 3 in a row correct: slightly harder next prompt (3 choices instead of 2)
- If struggling (2+ misses): simplify back down
- Kian's difficulty adjusts similarly

### Performance
- Keep existing adaptive particle system
- Offscreen canvas caching for MCX at common sizes
- Target: consistent 60fps

## Session Structure

1. Audio unlock screen (click to start)
2. Opening Mega Evolution (first visit) or short MCX roar intro (return visits)
3. Hub Screen — MCX + 6 gem orbs
4. Player picks a game (or uncle guides them)
5. Game intro flight → Game → Victory → Gem collected
6. Calm Reset (5-10s breather)
7. Back to Hub — gem now filled in, MCX visibly stronger
8. Repeat for all 6 games (or subset — uncle can go to finale early via Esc→Hub→click MCX)
9. Ultimate Finale when all gems collected (or uncle triggers via hidden control)

Total session: ~15-25 minutes (longer because games wait for player)
