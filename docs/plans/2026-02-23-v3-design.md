# Mega Charizard Academy v3 — Design Document

## Vision

Make every second of gameplay teach something while keeping MCX spectacle at maximum. The kids should ask to play again because it feels like training Mega Charizard X, while actually getting repeated, effective learning on colors, counting, shapes, and letters.

## Research-Backed Design Principles

These numbers come from developmental psychology research (Wilson 2019, Vlach & Sandhofer 2012, Pitchford & Mullen 2002, Wynn 1992, NN Group UX studies):

| Parameter | Owen (2.5) | Kian (4) |
|-----------|-----------|----------|
| Target success rate | 90-95% | 80-85% |
| Choices presented | 2 | 3-4 |
| Counting range | 1-3 (subitizing) | 1-7 (counting) |
| Colors | Red, blue, yellow (+green) | All 9 basic colors |
| Shapes | Circle, square, triangle | + rectangle, oval, star, heart, diamond |
| Phonics | No — letter exposure only | Initial sounds, rhyming |
| New concepts per session | 1-2 | 3-4 |
| Repetitions per concept | 4-6 times | 3-4 times |
| Prompts per game | 5 | 7-8 |
| Game duration | 2-3 min | 3-5 min |
| Full session | 10-15 min | 15-20 min |
| Hints before auto-complete | 2 wrong attempts | 3 wrong attempts |
| First hint delay | 5s | 8s |

## Part 1: Cross-Game Systems

### 1A. Educational Voice System ("Success Echo")

**This is the single highest-impact change.** Research is unanimous: verbal labeling during interaction produces dramatically stronger learning than visual-only presentation.

**The Three-Label Rule:** Every prompt gets the concept spoken 3 times:

1. **Prompt label:** "Red. Find red!"
2. **Action label (during animation):** "Reeeed..."
3. **Success echo:** "Red! Red flame!"

Format is always: **Name it → Do it → Confirm it.**

Short, consistent prompts. No long sentences during active play:
- "Red. Find red."
- "Three. Count three."
- "Circle. Find circle."
- "C. Trace C."

For wrong answers, label what was wrong AND redirect:
- "That's blue. Find red!"
- "That's four. We need three!"

### 1B. MCX Coach Mode (Hint Ladder)

Replace the current hint system with a 5-level MCX-personality-driven ladder:

| Level | Trigger | Owen | Kian |
|-------|---------|------|------|
| 0 | Prompt given | Normal prompt | Normal prompt |
| 1 | 5s (Owen) / 8s (Kian) no response, OR 1 miss | Voice repeats: "Red." | Voice repeats: "Find the red one." |
| 2 | 2nd miss or 10s (Owen) / 15s (Kian) | Correct target pulses/glows | Correct target subtle pulse |
| 3 | 3rd miss or 15s (Owen) | MCX looks toward correct target (nudge pose) + "Over here!" | Correct target glows strongly |
| 4 | Auto-complete (Owen: 3 miss, Kian: 4 miss) | MCX demonstrates answer, celebration anyway | MCX demonstrates, celebration anyway |

**Critical:** Auto-complete always triggers a celebration. No failure feeling, ever. The success echo still plays: "Red! There it is!"

Owen reaches stronger hints faster because his frustration threshold is much lower (research: 2.5-year-olds persist ~1 minute before disengaging).

### 1C. Pre-Prompt Engagement Lines

Before each prompt, address the active child by name:

- Owen's turn: "Owen, point!" or "Owen, look!"
- Kian's turn: "Kian, choose!" or "Kian, find it!"
- Team turn: "Both trainers!"

This is a genuine differentiator — research shows NO major educational app handles multi-child play well. Our uncle-mediated model with named engagement is unique.

### 1D. Narration Framing (MCX as Purpose)

Each game gets a one-line MCX-centric frame that plays once at game start:

- Flame Colors: "Help tune my flame!"
- Fireball Count: "Charge the right number!"
- Evolution Tower: "Forge my armor!"
- Sky Writer: "Write power runes!"

This keeps MCX central — not just a mascot, but the reason for the activity (Khan Academy Kids model: character IS the teacher).

### 1E. Educational Non-Interactive Moments

Current animations (beam travel, fireball flight, forge flames, MCX flight) are 1-4 seconds of dead time. Make them teach:

**During intro animations:**
- If target is RED, arriving particles/embers are red
- If target is 3, show 3 flashes/beats in sync
- If target is circle, brief circle silhouette before choices appear

**During action animations (beam, fireball, flight):**
- Voice stretches the label: "Reeeed..." (beam starts) → "Red!" (impact)
- Or counts along: "One... two... three!"
- Or names the shape: "Circle... forged!"

**During celebration:**
- Echo the learning item: "Blue! Nice job!" / "Five! Perfect count!" / "Triangle!"

**Rule:** Every prompt includes at least 2 repetitions of the concept — once in the prompt, once after success.

### 1F. Mega Flame Charge (Session Reward Meter)

A visible blue flame meter that fills across the whole session:

- Correct answer: +1 unit
- Independent correct (no hints): +2 units
- Auto-complete: +0.5 units

At thresholds, MCX does fan-service bursts:
- 25%: Wing flare (brief wing spread + blue particles)
- 50%: Blue flame burst (mouth flames intensify for 3s)
- 75%: Aura pulse (blue glow surrounds MCX)
- 100%: Mega Roar (full roar animation + screen-wide particles)

This gives both kids a reason to stay engaged prompt-to-prompt. Research note: visual progress meters work well for age 4 (Kian) but the spectacle payoffs are what motivate Owen — he won't track the meter, but he'll love the wing flare.

**Implementation:** Simple counter in session state. Meter rendered on hub screen and as a small bar in games. Threshold events triggered in game code.

### 1G. Adaptive Micro-Adjustments

Track a rolling window of the last 5 answers per child:

- **4-5 correct:** Slightly harder next prompt (add a distractor, remove initial hint glow)
- **2-3 correct:** Maintain current level
- **0-1 correct:** Slightly easier (reduce to minimum distractors, faster hints, more obvious scaffolding)

Also track per-concept difficulty:
- If "purple" was missed twice, present "purple" again 2-3 prompts later (within-session spaced repetition)
- If "triangle" was slow, repeat "triangle" in the next game that uses shapes

This is simple rule-based adaptation — no complex algorithms needed.

### 1H. Cleaner Choice Moments

During the decision moment (when the child needs to point/choose):
- Target prompt is the brightest, most stable thing on screen
- Background effects dim slightly (reduce particle spawn rate 50%)
- Distractors pause movement briefly while prompt is spoken (0.5s freeze)
- Click targets are big and well-separated (especially Owen: minimum 300px apart)
- No overlapping glows between choices

After the child clicks, spectacle resumes at full intensity.

## Part 2: Game-Specific Improvements

### Game 1: Flame Colors

**Narration frame:** "Help tune my flame!"

**Core change: MCX's body IS the teaching anchor.** MCX's mouth-corner flames, tail flame, and chest glow display the target color. "Make my flame red!" ties color learning directly to their obsession.

**Educational upgrades:**
- Prompt format: "Red. Find red!" → (on success) → "Red flame!"
- During beam animation: "Reeeed..." → (impact) → "Red!"
- MCX's flame changes to target color as the prompt is given (visual + verbal pairing)
- On success, MCX's entire flame system briefly burns the correct color

**Owen mode (tightened):**
- 2 choices, minimum 400px apart
- Primary colors only: red, blue, yellow. Add green only after 2 successful sessions (tracked in settings)
- High-contrast dark backgrounds behind each target blob
- Correct target has a subtle soft glow from the start (research: 2.5-year-olds benefit from initial scaffolding)
- Targets don't move/drift — stable positions. Movement causes confusion at this age
- 5 prompts per round

**Kian mode (progressive):**
- 3-4 choices
- Full color palette (red, blue, yellow, green, orange, purple)
- Start with basic recognition, but after 3 correct: add one challenge prompt:
  - Speed round: "Quick! Purple!"
  - Recall: "What color was my flame?" (MCX flame goes neutral, child picks from memory)
- "MCX Blue" gets special treatment: "Mega Blue Flame!" — canonical blue flame is the reward color
- 7 prompts per round

**MCX spectacle upgrade:**
- 3-correct streak → wing flare burst
- Completing all prompts → brief "Mega Flame Surge" (blue aura, 2s)

### Game 2: Fireball Count

**Narration frame:** "Charge the right number!"

**Core change: Counting feedback is INSTANT, not delayed.** Currently the fireball takes 1.8s to reach the target. The count recognition should happen at CLICK TIME, not impact time:
- Click → count ring fills immediately + voice says the number + pip lights up
- Fireball travel is the "reward animation" (still looks cool, but learning already happened)

**Educational upgrades:**
- On every click: voice counts "One... Two... Three..." in sync
- Visible count track fills left-to-right (horizontal pips, big and clear)
- On completion: "Three! Perfect charge!" (success echo)
- During waddle-in/intro: rhythmic beats matching target number (3 drum beats for 3)

**Owen mode (critical for one-to-one correspondence):**
- Numbers 1-3 only (subitizing range — research says 2.5-year-olds are "1-knowers" at best)
- Exact number of targets (can't overshoot)
- Always show: big numeral + matching quantity of pips + matching targets
- Slow, rhythmic: "Count two. One... two!" (voice leads the count)
- Very generous click timing — no rush
- 5 prompts per round

**Kian mode (progressive):**
- Numbers 1-7
- Overshoot is educational: "Oops — too many. We needed five." MCX removes excess charge visibly
- After 3 correct: add a challenge:
  - "One more than three!" (simple addition exposure)
  - "Stop at five!" (stop-count discipline)
- 7 prompts per round

**MCX spectacle upgrade:**
- Each click charges MCX horns/chest glow incrementally
- Exact count = "Perfect charge!" with brief power burst
- 3-correct streak = "Mega Overcharge" visual burst (MCX eyes blaze)

### Game 3: Evolution Tower

**Narration frame:** "Forge my armor!"

**Core change: Make the two modes visually distinct.** Currently shape-mode and size-mode alternate silently. Present them clearly:
- Shape Forge: "Find the shape!" — tower building with matching shapes
- Size Training: "Which is bigger?" — comparison challenges

**Educational upgrades:**
- Target shape appears large and stable before choices appear (1s preview)
- Prompt: "Circle. Find circle." → (on success) → "Circle forged!"
- During forge animation: "Circle... forging circle..."
- Occasionally tie shapes to MCX anatomy: "Triangle — like MCX's wings!"

**Owen mode:**
- Circle, square, triangle only (the "Big Three" — research-confirmed for 2.5)
- 2 choices, big chunky silhouettes, no decorative noise
- No rotations or skews — always prototypical orientation
- Size mode: BIG vs SMALL only, exaggerated differences (3:1 ratio minimum)
- Correct shape can have subtle glow from start
- 5 prompts per round

**Kian mode (progressive):**
- Add star, heart, diamond, oval gradually
- After 3 correct: add challenge prompts:
  - Negative: "Which is NOT a triangle?"
  - Recall: "What shape did we just forge?" (after shape placed)
  - Size ordering: "Smallest to biggest!" (3-item sequence)
- 7 prompts per round

**MCX spectacle:**
- Each forged block adds visible "armor energy" to MCX (incremental glow)
- Complete tower → MCX lands on top with wing spread celebration
- 3-correct streak → forge fire flare

### Game 4: Sky Writer

**Narration frame:** "Write power runes!"

**Core change: Owen mode is letter EXPOSURE, not precision tracing.** Research is clear: phonics is NOT developmentally appropriate at 2.5. Owen's mode should be purely "letter awareness" — seeing letters as visual symbols.

**Owen mode (letter exposure + guided success):**
- Giant letter silhouette appears first (1s glow preview): "This is C!"
- Only 2-3 star dots (connecting them is trivially easy)
- Very generous auto-snap (120px click radius — nearly auto-connects)
- Auto-demo after 8s timeout (MCX traces it, celebration anyway)
- NO phonics quiz
- Voice labels only: "C! C for Charizard!"
- Focus on: see the letter → trace roughly → hear the name → celebrate
- 4 prompts per round (letters: C, F, S, B)

**Kian mode (challenge with pacing):**
- 4-5 star dots, strict click order
- Alternate phonics to prevent fatigue:
  - Letter 1: trace only
  - Letter 2: trace + simple phonics ("C says /k/! What starts with C?" — 2 choices, not 3)
  - Letter 3: trace only
  - Letter 4: trace + phonics
- 6 prompts per round

**Educational upgrades:**
- While MCX flies between stars: voice labels step order "One... two... three..." and repeats letter "C... C..."
- Completed letter becomes a "power rune" that orbits MCX briefly
- After all letters: MCX's collected runes glow and dissipate (visual reward)

**MCX spectacle:**
- Traced letters glow as blue fire runes
- Final team letter could be "X" — huge wow moment (the Mega Charizard X)
- 3-correct streak → rune aura pulse around MCX

## Part 3: New Games

**Recommendation: Focus on perfecting the 4 existing games first.** The session is already 15-20 minutes with 4 games. However, two new games fill genuine educational gaps:

### Optional Game 5: Lava Path Numbers (Number Recognition + Sequencing)

**Why it's needed:** Fireball Count teaches counting (clicking to count). This teaches number RECOGNITION (seeing a numeral and knowing what it means) and SEQUENCING (knowing that 3 comes after 2). These are different skills.

**How it works:**
- Stepping stones across a lava field, labeled with numbers
- Prompt: "Step on number 3!" (single recognition) or "Go 1, 2, 3!" (sequence)
- Click correct stone → MCX leaps across with cool flame-trail animation

**Owen:** 1-3 only, single target ("Find 2"), huge numerals + matching pips on each stone. 2 stones visible.

**Kian:** 1-7, sequence challenges ("Walk 1, 2, 3, 4"), missing number ("What comes after 4?"). 4-5 stones visible.

### Optional Game 6: Roar Echo (Phonics / Sound Discrimination)

**Why it's needed:** Sky Writer requires motor precision (tracing) to access phonics. This game teaches phonics WITHOUT tracing — pure sound matching. Critical for varied phonics exposure without Sky Writer fatigue.

**How it works:**
- MCX roars a sound: "/k/!" displayed as a glowing rune
- 2-3 icons appear (Charizard, Fire, Star)
- Prompt: "Which starts with /k/?"
- Click matching icon → MCX echoes the sound + icon explodes in blue fire

**Owen:** Sound EXPOSURE only — "C says /k/! C for Charizard!" with auto-advancing. 2 choices. No expectation of correct matching.

**Kian:** Simple first-sound matching. "Which starts with /f/?" with 2 choices initially, 3 later.

**Note:** Only add these games if the 4 core games feel solid. Better to have 4 excellent games than 6 mediocre ones.

## Part 4: Session Flow Improvements

### Enhanced Calm Resets

Keep the 3 existing variations but add light-touch educational reinforcement:

1. **Power Up:** Slow breathing glow + soft color naming: "Blue glow... blue..."
2. **Stargazing:** Stars appear + soft counting: "One star... two stars... three..."
3. **Flame Rest:** Flame grows + size words: "Small flame... big flame..."

Voice is slow, gentle, almost whispered. This is regulation first, education second.

### Hub Improvements

- MCX greets by current child's name on return: "Welcome back, Owen!"
- Gem orbs pulse gently with educational content from their game:
  - Colors gem shows rotating colors
  - Counting gem shows rotating numbers
  - Shapes gem shows rotating shapes
  - Letters gem shows rotating letters

## Part 5: Uncle Assist Features

Hidden overlays toggled by hotkey (not visible to kids by default):

| Key | Feature |
|-----|---------|
| `H` | Show correct answer indicator (tiny corner highlight on correct target) |
| `D` | Show debug: current mode, hint level, success rate, concept tracking |
| `M` | Slow-motion demo mode (MCX demonstrates next answer before player turn) |

These help uncle facilitate without kids seeing the scaffolding.

---

## Part 6: Content Priorities

### Colors (priority order)
1. Red, blue, yellow (primary — start here)
2. Green (add after stable success with primary)
3. Orange, purple (extended)
4. "MCX Blue" as special anchor: "Mega Blue Flame!" canonical color

### Counting (priority order)
1. 1-3 (Owen's range — subitizing)
2. 1-7 (Kian's range — cardinal counting)
3. Count MCX-themed objects: flames, fireballs, wing beats, stars, runes

### Shapes (priority order)
1. Circle, square, triangle (Big Three)
2. Rectangle, oval (similar-but-different — good for Kian discrimination)
3. Star, heart, diamond (fun shapes)
4. "X" motif as special late shape for Kian

### Letters (priority order)
1. C (Charizard), F (Fire), S (Star), B (Blue) — MCX-themed
2. X (Mega Charizard X — special team finale letter)
3. Owen: exposure only (see letter, hear name)
4. Kian: initial sound matching (/k/ for C, /f/ for F, /s/ for S, /b/ for B)

---

## Part 7: What I Cut From the Brief (and Why)

These were proposed but I'm recommending against them:

| Idea | Why Not |
|------|---------|
| Kian counting to 20 | Research: 4-year-olds reliably count to 7-10. 20 is too ambitious and risks frustration below 80% success. |
| "One more than 3" for Kian | Pushing into addition territory. Keep in counting game as an occasional challenge prompt only, not a core mechanic. |
| "Find two circles" (sequential selection) | Multi-step selection is too complex for this interaction model (uncle clicking while kids point). Keep to single-click answers. |
| "Sequence memory: square then star" | Working memory sequencing requires sustained attention beyond what this game format supports. Save for a dedicated memory game later. |
| Wing Beat Match (rhythm game) | Rhythm matching requires precise timing which conflicts with the uncle-mediated click model. Kids hear rhythm, uncle must reproduce it — too many steps. |
| Tail Flame Fuel | Too similar to Flame Colors (both are color matching). Doesn't fill an educational gap. |
| Mega Armor Plates | Too similar to Evolution Tower (both are shape matching). |
| Dragon Egg Hatch Count | Too similar to Fireball Count (both are counting). |
| Mega Memory Sparks | Working memory games need careful calibration. At 2.5, even a 2-item sequence is unreliable. At 4, this could work but adds session length. Save for v4. |
| Mega Mode 15s windows | Adds complexity without educational value. The threshold burst events (wing flare, flame burst) are simpler and equally exciting. |
| "Small red gem" (dual attribute for Kian) | This is a good concept but should only appear as an occasional challenge prompt in Flame Colors, not a core mechanic. |
| Complex Kian challenge ladders | Keep challenge prompts to 1 per game round (after 3 correct). Don't turn the whole game into a progression system. |

---
